    <label>archotech brain melder</label>
    <description>An impressive feat of medical engineering using attomachines. These leak from the main hub into the bloodstream which constantly heal any long term scars. However, the main control hub for these attomachines resides in the Parietal lobe and parts of the Cerebellum, removing the subject's sense of pain, while overall increasing conciousness and happiness. Further study of the device finds contradictions in the laws of quantumn physics as well as a high probability of artificial sentience residing within. It's workings are near-impossible for the human mind to concieve.</description>

    <description>An astounding level of detail has been placed into this creation, unbeknownst to it's creator. The atomic ridges throughout the membrane carry energy from what seems to be the quantumn foam into the membrane itself, allowing it to stay powered permanently. Much like other Archotech items, no one knows how it works. Once the membrane is attached it is hard to take it off, and it will shape itself to it's weilder's exact bodyshape. almost like a tight fitting suit. It deflects both melee and ranged attacks.</description>
